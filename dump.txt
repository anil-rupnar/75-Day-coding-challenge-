75 days Hard coding challenge.
Excited to tackle Day 19 of the 75-day coding challenge!
#Day19

Problem statement: 
    write a program to convert Decimal to binary.
    
example:
    input:7
    output:111
    
    input:10
    output:1o1o
    
Algorithm Steps:

Input:
    Accept a decimal number as input.
Initialize Variables:
    Set a variable to store the binary representation.
Conversion Process:
    Divide the decimal number by 2 and note the remainder.
    Update the decimal number with the quotient obtained from the division.
    Append the remainder to the binary representation.
Repeat:
    Repeat steps 3 until the decimal number becomes 0.
Reverse:
    The binary representation obtained in step 3 will be in reverse order. Reverse it to get the correct binary representation.
Output:
    Display the binary representation as the output.
